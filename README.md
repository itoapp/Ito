Ito is a free, open-source client for iPhone and iPad. It combines dedicated readers, native video playback, AniList integration, and an extensible WebAssembly plugin system in a single app.

## Features

* **Anime, manga, and novels** — Keep different media types together in one library.
* **Native reading** — Dedicated manga and novel readers designed for iOS.
* **Native video playback** — Select available video quality, audio tracks, and subtitles.
* **AniList discovery** — Browse, search, and filter titles using AniList.
* **Progress tracking** — Connect AniList to track what you read and watch.
* **WASM plugins** — Install `.ito` plugins from user-added repositories. Downloaded packages are SHA-256 verified before installation.
* **Backup and migration** — Export native `.itobackup` files or import libraries from Aidoku and Paperback.
* **On-device storage** — Library data and history are stored locally, with tracker credentials protected by Keychain.
* **No advertisements** — Ito is free and ad-free.

## Build from source

### Requirements

* Xcode 26.2 or later
* Swift 6.2
* iOS or iPadOS 15.4 deployment target
* Swift Package Manager

Ito uses `ito-runner` as a local Swift package. Both repositories must be placed in the same parent directory:

```text
ito-dev/
├── Ito/
└── ito-runner/
```

Clone and open the project:

```sh
mkdir ito-dev
cd ito-dev

git clone https://github.com/itoapp/ito-runner.git
git clone https://github.com/itoapp/Ito.git

open Ito/Ito.xcodeproj
```

Allow Swift Package Manager to resolve the remaining dependencies, select a signing team and target device, then build with `⌘R`.
